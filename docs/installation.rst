==============
 Installation
==============

You are highly encouraged to use `virtualenv`_ and `pip`_ to
facilitate pycontrol-shed's installation.  The tools allow you to
install pycontrol-shed's prerequisites in a sandboxed environment that
keeps your system libraries in pristine condition. Note that `pip`_ comes
along for the ride when you install `virtualenv`_, so start there if you
don't already have it installed.

Prerequisites
=============

Most of the prerequisites will be downloaded and installed
automatically, but the `pyControl v2 library`_ is stuck behind a login
screen.  Registration is free, so don't let that stop you.

Installation Procedure
======================

1. Follow the installation instructions for the `pyControl v2 library`_.
2. Download `PyControl Shell Edition`_
3. cd $YOUR_PYCONTROL_SHELL_EDITION_DIR && python setup.py install
